## Icons
We use [Unicons](https://iconscout.com/unicons) by IconScout. See them on [IconScout's website](https://iconscout.com/unicons/explore/line) or on [Iconify](https://iconify.design/icon-sets/uil/). Please only use icons from this set unless you have explicit permission to use another set. When adding an icon, download it to ``/images/icons/iconname.svg``. 

## Colors
Our color theme is orange {{< color-preview "#ff7b26" >}} `#ff7b26` and white {{< color-preview "#fff" >}} `#fff`. These colors make up the top bar on our webpages, as well as some other elements. 

For our (default) dark theme, our main colors are {{< color-preview "#2a2a2a" >}} `#2a2a2a` {{< color-preview "#222" >}} `#222` {{< color-preview "#000" >}} `#000`.

For our light theme, our main colors are {{< color-preview "#f0f0f0" >}} `#f0f0f0` {{< color-preview "#aaa" >}} `#aaa` {{< color-preview "#dddddd" >}} `#dddddd`.

There are of course many other colors we use around our pages, but these colors are most common.
